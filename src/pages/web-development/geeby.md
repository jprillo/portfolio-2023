Geeby is a Gastby starter that uses Netlify to manage content and hosting. Static site generators are great for diplaying business websites and I made this to serve clients in a way that they could manage thier own content and blog without any overhead or having to talk to me. Like at all. 

The only problem is the code when cloned releases a purple monster. I don;t know where it comes from or how it got to be so evil but it is a real little fucker and not to be taken lightly. 

So enjoy this starter and the security and speed of a static site generator but really remember speed... because your going to need it because you know. the monster.
