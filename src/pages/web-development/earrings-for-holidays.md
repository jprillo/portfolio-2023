Earrings for holidays is a square eccomerce site. We were using Square for the ability to sell earrings on location with there easy to use credit card app and I don't think we paid anything to get started and have no monthly. It has an API as well that I could populate a front end with but we are going to have to sell a lot more earrings before I do that.
