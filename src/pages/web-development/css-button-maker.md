This is one of the first project I takled when I was at the beginning with Java Script. Whe I had it online it was by far the best performing and popular of any projects I never used it becuase after I finished the project building buttons that way for me was allready redundant. I lost all traffic once I took it off it's own domain. I always say one day I am going to refactor it and change the insane way I named things but then I remember what I was like 5 years ago. If i could go back in time what I would tell you.
