This is one of the first project I tackled when I was at the beginning with Java Script. I never used it because after I finished the project building buttons that way for me was allready redundant. {eople did use it because I used to track the analytics. I lost all traffic once I took it off it's own domain. I always say one day I am going to refactor it and change the insane way I named things but then I remember what I was like in 2017. If I could go back in time what I would tell myself. Probably that I can refactor this code with artifical intelligence relatively easily. I still won't though.  

I also just noticed that I should change the Netlify domain to be more specific. Lets face it, if you go there and want actual buttons your also a nerd.
