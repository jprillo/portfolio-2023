Formal Flamingo is a web development agency in Palm Bay Florida. We give business' a leg up on the competitiion. Get it. It is a flamingo joke. No one really likes it though.  

We started doing a variety of small jobs like making powerpoints and setting up emails to developing full stack applications. Want a website like this for your business? Maybe your ex wife is getting married and you want to make a website about her hunky new man's criminal history. Let's talk about.
