Formal Flamingo is a web development agency in Palm Bay Florida. 

We started doing a variety of small jobs like making powerpoints and setting up emails to developing full stack applications

I have a blog I took off because I am terrible writer but I have a feeling my new employee     "Allen Iverson" is going to help me out a lot with that.
